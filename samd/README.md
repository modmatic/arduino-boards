# Arduino Core for SAMD21 CPU

This repository contains the source code and configuration files of the Arduino Core
for Atmel's SAMD21 processor (used on the Arduino/Genuino Zero, MKR1000 and MKRZero boards).
It has been modified to support Modmatic SAMD boards like the dotMG SAMD21E Cart.

## Installation on Arduino IDE

This core is available as a package in the Arduino IDE cores manager.
Just open the "Boards Manager" and install the package called:

"Modmatic SAMD (32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+) Boards"

## Support

There is a dedicated section of the Arduino Forum for general discussion and project assistance:

http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?board=98.0
